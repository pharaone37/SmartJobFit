## Migration Steps (From Replit to External Host)

### 1. Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Export your code from Replit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/smartjobfit.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Create these environment variables in your hosting platform:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
REPLIT_DOMAINS=smartjobfit.com,www.smartjobfit.com
ISSUER_URL=https://replit.com/oidc
REPL_ID=your_repl_id
```

### 3. Database Migration
- Export your PostgreSQL data from Replit
- Import to new database (Neon, PlanetScale, or host's database)
- Update DATABASE_URL environment variable

### 4. Build Configuration
Most platforms will automatically detect your build settings, but you may need:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
    "build:client": "vite build",
    "build:server": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/server/index.js"
  }
}
```

### 5. Domain Setup
1. Update DNS records to point to new host
2. Configure SSL certificate
3. Test domain connection

## Recommended Approach

### For Immediate Launch:
1. **Use Replit Deployments** - quickest path to production
2. Set up custom domain (smartjobfit.com)
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy with one click

### For Long-term Growth:
1. **Migrate to Vercel** - better performance and scaling
2. Use Neon PostgreSQL for database
3. Set up proper CI/CD pipeline
4. Implement monitoring and analytics

## Cost Comparison (Monthly)

| Platform | Basic Plan | Database | SSL | Custom Domain |
|----------|------------|----------|-----|---------------|
| Replit | $7 | Included | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vercel | Free-$20 | External | ✓ | ✓ |
| Railway | $5 | $5 | ✓ | ✓ |
| DigitalOcean | $5 | $15 | ✓ | ✓ |

## Current Recommendation

**Start with Replit Deployments** because:
- Your code is already here
- Zero configuration needed
- Built-in database and SSL
- Easy custom domain setup
- Can always migrate later

**Migration Path:**
1. Launch on Replit Deployments (immediate)
2. Set up monitoring and analytics
3. As you grow, migrate to Vercel + Neon (3-6 months)
4. Scale to enterprise hosting as needed

Would you like me to help you deploy on Replit first, or do you prefer to start with an external platform?
